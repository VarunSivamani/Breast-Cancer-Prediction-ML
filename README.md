# Breast Cancer Prediction

---

Cancer is a generic term for a large group of diseases that can affect any part of the body. Breast cancer is cancer that forms in the cells of the breasts. Breast cancer has now overtaken lung cancer as the world's mostly commonly-diagnosed cancer, according to statistics released by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in December 2020. Breast cancer can occur in both men and women, but it's far more common in women.

# Problem :

Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020 .The most common in 2020 (in terms of new cases of cancer) were:

- Breast (2.26 million cases)
- Lung (2.21 million cases)
- Colon and Rectum (1.93 million cases)
- Prostate (1.41 million cases)
- Skin (non-melanoma) (1.20 million cases)
- Stomach (1.09 million cases)

The most common causes of cancer death in 2020 were:

- Lung (1.80 million deaths)
- Colon and Rectum (916 000 deaths)
- Liver (830 000 deaths)
- Stomach (769 000 deaths)
- Breast (685 000 deaths).

Each year, approximately 400 000 children develop cancer. The most common cancers vary between countries.
